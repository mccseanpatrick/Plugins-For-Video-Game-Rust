# Plugins-For-Video-Game-Rust
Here are some plugins I created for the steam game Rust

Plugins implement Oxide, a popular open source framework that makes plugin design for rust simple.
All plugins are standalone files as that is the design pattern followed by oxide, allowing plugin distribution to be quick and simple.

Rust plugins are required to be single files, it is possible to put them into multiple files but they would have to be rebuilt into a singluar one to be used on a server.
